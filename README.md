# Mobile-Price-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning

## We are going to do implementing a salable model for predicting the mobile price prediction using some of the regression techniques based of some of features in the dataset which is called mobile Price Prediction. 

## There are some of the processing techniques for creating a model.

## Factors Considered: battery capacity, color, clock speed, dual sim, network type, storage capacity, weight, height, weight, ram, 

## This kind of prediction will help companies estimate price of mobiles to give tough competion to other mobile manufacturer
